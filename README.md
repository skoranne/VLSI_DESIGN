Experiments with VLSI DESIGN

In 1996 for my Major Project in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)
program at MACT (now NIT) Bhopal, I worked with Dr. R. P. Singh who suggested
I read an ACM Survey Paper 
ACM Computing SurveysVolume 23
Issue 2June 1991 pp 220
https://doi.org/10.1145/103724.103725143

For this project I decided to implement 3 algorithms:
1) Min-cut placement using Breuer
2) Simulated Annealing (this worked as expected)
3) Force directed placement (this helped me later, but was much harder)

This project introduced me to CAD of VLSI, also known as EDA
(electronic design automation) and I have been fortunate enough to
stay in this field for more than 25 years.

In this repository I will try to recreate some of my early experiments
and findings.
